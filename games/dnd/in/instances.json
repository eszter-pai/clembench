The adventurers are people exploring a dungeon in which there is an enemy, called a “boss”, they must defeat to win the game.\nThe dungeon is made up of a 5x5 grid. Cells are labelled by letter-number combinations, whereby the letter (A-E) corresponds to the row index and the number (1-5) to the column index going left to right, top to bottom. For example, if a player is in the top left cell of the grid, they are at position A1.\nEach turn, a player can move in the dungeon and perform an action.There are 5 types of actions: attack, spell, cantrip, block, and use healing item. The actions available to the player are determined by their class. Most actions require a dice roll to determine their outcome.

Does not change.\nA player can only move along adjacent cells in the dungeon and cannot move diagonally or over a cell that is blocked or occupied by another player. A player may move only a fraction of their stamina or not move at all. \nThis game is played with dice which are labelled by the number or surfaces they have. For example, a d6 die has 6 surfaces. Dice are given in counts of how many times they are rolled. The result is a sum of each roll. For example, 3d6 means a d6 die is rolled 3 times and its rolls are summed up.
