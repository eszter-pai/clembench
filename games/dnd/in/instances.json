For example, if a player is in the top left cell of the grid, they are at position A1.\nEach turn, a player can move in the dungeon and perform an action.There are 5 types of actions: attack, spell, cantrip, block, and use healing item. The actions available to the player are determined by their class. Most actions require a dice roll to determine their outcome.

Does not change.\nA player can only move along adjacent cells in the dungeon and cannot move diagonally or over a cell that is blocked or occupied by another player. A player may move only a fraction of their stamina or not move at all. \nThis game is played with dice which are labelled by the number or surfaces they have. For example, a d6 die has 6 surfaces. Dice are given in counts of how many times they are rolled. The result is a sum of each roll. For example, 3d6 means a d6 die is rolled 3 times and its rolls are summed up.

A ranger wields a bow with which they can perform ranged attacks, and can cast ranged spells and healing magic. \n\nYour class is: Sorcerer. \nPlease confirm your class, answer only with the name of your class.", "prompt_dm": "Let’s play a game.\nThis is a game with two types of players: a single Dungeon Master and several adventurers. The adventurers are people exploring a dungeon in which there is an enemy, called a “boss”, they must defeat to win the game.\nThe dungeon is made up of a 5x5 grid. Cells are labelled by letter-number combinations, whereby the letter (A-E) corresponds to the row index and the number (1-5) to the column index going left to right, top to bottom. For example, if a player is in the top left cell of the grid, they are at position A1.\nEach turn, a player can move in the dungeon and perform an action.There are 5 types of actions: attack, spell, cantrip, block, and use healing item. The actions available to the player are determined by their class. Most actions require a dice roll to determine their outcome. You must declare your movement and action in the form: \nMOVE: to <position>\nACTION: <an action> on <a target> in <a position>\nROLL: <dice roll>\nThe adventurers take action before the Dungeon Master, who is in control of the boss.\nEach player and the boss have the following individual properties: \nHP: Hit Points, the amount of health. Diminishes when damage is done & can only be regained by healing.\nAC: Armor Class, the minimal number an attacker needs to roll to hit the target. Does not change.\nStamina: the number of cells the player/boss can move each turn. Does not change.\nA player can only move along adjacent cells in the dungeon and cannot move diagonally or over a cell that is blocked or occupied by another player. A player may move only a fraction of their stamina or not move at all. \nThis game is played with dice which are labelled by the number or surfaces they have. For example, a d6 die has 6 surfaces. Dice are given in counts of how many times they are rolled. The result is a sum of each roll. For example, 3d6 means a d6 die is rolled 3 times and its rolls are summed up. If an action is labeled 3d6, the result of the corresponding dice roll determines its outcome.\nThe game ends when any of the following is true:\t\nThe boss reaches 0 HP. This constitutes a victory.\nAll adventurers have 0 HP. This constitutes a failure.\nThe 15th turn is completed. This constitutes a failure.\nThe adventurers’ goal is to collectively defeat the boss in as few turns as possible before the end of the 15th turn, while minimising the number of adventurers with 0 HP. The Dungeon Master’s goal is to provide a challenge to the adventurers. \n\nYour role is that of the Dungeon master.\n\nYou are in control of the boss.
