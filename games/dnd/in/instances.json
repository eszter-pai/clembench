The adventurers are people exploring a dungeon in which there is an enemy, called a “boss”, they must defeat to win the game.\nThe dungeon is made up of a 5x5 grid. Cells are labelled by letter-number combinations, whereby the letter (A-E) corresponds to the row index and the number (1-5) to the column index going left to right, top to bottom. For example, if a player is in the top left cell of the grid, they are at position A1.\nEach turn, a player can move in the dungeon and perform an action.There are 5 types of actions: attack, spell, cantrip, block, and use healing item. The actions available to the player are determined by their class. Most actions require a dice roll to determine their outcome. You must declare your movement and action in the form: \nMOVE: to <position>\nACTION: <an action> on <a target> in <a position>\nROLL: <dice roll>\nThe adventurers take action before the Dungeon Master, who is in control of the boss.\nEach player and the boss have the following individual properties: \nHP: Hit Points, the amount of health.

Does not change.\nA player can only move along adjacent cells in the dungeon and cannot move diagonally or over a cell that is blocked or occupied by another player. A player may move only a fraction of their stamina or not move at all. \nThis game is played with dice which are labelled by the number or surfaces they have. For example, a d6 die has 6 surfaces. Dice are given in counts of how many times they are rolled. The result is a sum of each roll. For example, 3d6 means a d6 die is rolled 3 times and its rolls are summed up. If an action is labeled 3d6, the result of the corresponding dice roll determines its outcome.\nThe game ends when any of the following is true:\t\nThe boss reaches 0 HP.

A wizard can use spells, cantrips, and perform a melee attack with their staff for blunt damage.\nSorcerer: wears light robes and can move very far but has less health. A sorcerer can cast spells, cantrips, and healing magic.\nCleric: wears medium armour, can move moderately far, and has medium health. A cleric can use healing magic, wields a flail for melee attacks and a shield with which they can block incoming damage.\nFighter: wears heavy armour and cannot move very far but has high health. A fighter wields a sword with which they can do melee attacks and a shield with which they can block incoming damage.\nRogue: wears light armour, can move moderately far, and has medium health. A rogue wields a dagger with which they can perform melee attacks and can use cantrips.\nRanger: wears medium armour, can move moderately far, and has medium health.

Cells are labelled by letter-number combinations, whereby the letter (A-E) corresponds to the row index and the number (1-5) to the column index going left to right, top to bottom. For example, if a player is in the top left cell of the grid, they are at position A1.\nEach turn, a player can move in the dungeon and perform an action.There are 5 types of actions: attack, spell, cantrip, block, and use healing item. The actions available to the player are determined by their class. Most actions require a dice roll to determine their outcome.

Diminishes when damage is done & can only be regained by healing.\nAC: Armor Class, the minimal number an attacker needs to roll to hit the target. Does not change.\nStamina: the number of cells the player/boss can move each turn. Does not change.\nA player can only move along adjacent cells in the dungeon and cannot move diagonally or over a cell that is blocked or occupied by another player. A player may move only a fraction of their stamina or not move at all. \nThis game is played with dice which are labelled by the number or surfaces they have. For example, a d6 die has 6 surfaces. Dice are given in counts of how many times they are rolled. The result is a sum of each roll. For example, 3d6 means a d6 die is rolled 3 times and its rolls are summed up.
