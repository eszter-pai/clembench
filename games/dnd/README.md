# Dungeon & Dragon-Inspired Game

Developed by Ronja & Eszter as part of the Cognitive Systems Master's program at the University of Potsdam.

## Game Overview

This game is inspired by the classic Dungeons & Dragons format. It involves three players: two adventurers and one Dungeon Master (DM). The adventurers aim to defeat the boss controlled by the DM within a dungeon.

## Player Roles and Classes

- **2 Adventurers:** Choose from the following classes: Wizard, Sorcerer, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Ranger

- **1 Dungeon Master:** Controls the dungeon's boss and aims to defeat the adventurers.

## Dungeon Layout

- The dungeon is a 5x5 grid labeled from rows A to E and columns 1 to 5 (e.g., The monster ðŸ‘¾ in the dungeon above spawns at C5).
- Some cells are blocked, and players cannot move onto these cells.

## Gameplay

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57859768-240e-48a8-b000-6eadd4d01b90)
- **Turn Order:** Player 1 â†’ Player 2 â†’ Dungeon Master, and then repeat. If the gameplay reaches **15 turns and boss is still alive (HP>0), the game fails.**
- **Actions:** On their turn, players select an action based on their class, then roll a dice to determine the outcome (damage dealt, healing done, etc.). If an action is a spell, the player needs to remember the number of spell slots. If the spell has spell slots 7, that means the spell can only be used 7 times in this game. A player can also choose to use a potion to heal themselves, however 2 adventurers share only 5 potions together.
- **Game Versions**: There are guided and unguided versions. If guided, the game master informs the player the number of resources they have left. For example: If there are only 4 potions left, the player is a spell caster so they need to consider spell slots, then this line will be added into the prompt if the game is guided, **You and Player B have 4 potions left, and you have 6 spell slots left.**

## Player Turn Format

Each player must follow this format during their combat turn:

- **MOVE:** `<position>`
- **ACTION:** `<action>`
- **TARGET:** `<target>` in `<targetâ€™s position>`
- **ROLL:** `<dice roll result>` (sum only, individual roll results are not shown)

## Results

Results can be found in the `results` directory of the main branch. We ran all 4 game modes on 4 different cLLMs, and additionally ran llama-3.1-8b on guided-reprompt. Files are named by mode; in order to run evaluation, results directories must be renamed 'dnd'.
